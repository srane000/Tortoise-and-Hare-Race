# Tortoise-and-Hare-Race
This project simulates the a race using a random number generator between a Tortoise and a Hare. The finish line is at square 100. The first contender to reach or pass square 100 wins. The course
weaves its way up the side of a slipper mountain, so occasionally the contenders lose ground. A clock ticks once per second. With each tick of the clock, the position of the animals change.
